BUGS:
FINAL: tweak surveillance-camera behaviour/timing

alpha: 
 make puzzle2 (level1_end)

adding:
 better vantage point by trees?
 water, x  water-splash   - https://opengameart.org/content/water-splash-yo-frankie
 nightfall-atmospheric? fog, light reflection,  extra: env will change based on switching in HMI
 add more scenery schrubs, cars, signs etc.
x  static         - https://opengameart.org/content/static-noise-similar-untuned-tv-also-known-white-noise
x  walki-talkie/radio beep/bzzt - dialog - https://opengameart.org/content/camerashudder


option: have engineer respond to camera???? not in MVP...

objectives:

 triggers near bay/station/telecom-controllers(message: nah, too easy ;) )


ninja       - cannot enter powerline with power
            + when power is down, he can reach switchyard, but no lockpick skills
	    + can blowdart hedgehog?? catch22?
            + trafo is sabotaged by ninja+drone pilot

hacker      - cannot climb substation without help from drone
	    (+ can disable alarm/camera??????)
	    + can do lockpick, 
	    + can modify HMI to disable power, (and re-enable after ninja sabotage )
              (alternative: wait for hedgehog/mechanic to re-enable?)

drone pilot - drone gets attacked by bird
            + areal reconneisance?
	    + can throw acorn to knock out guard/camera
	    + will provide drone support for hacker transport,  allows hacker to traverse fence and stay undetected

Puzzle1:
you can modify the circuit (by wire? by input? how to do this robust, without removing the 'fun' or overcomplicating?) -> provide datasheets of IC's as hint
if you force WP high, you prevent the tries from incrementing
with infinite tries, you should be able to do it in 25 attempts or so.


Puzzle2:
????
top view
switch components, and ensure protection does not work correctly, so that 5 trafo's destruct
part switchyard, part protection-bays

hacker:
 - SWITCHGEAR CABINET DESTRUCTION 
  modify protection settings
  send timed-oper, with interlock override for disconnector/earh-switch, per outgoing bay
 - DUAL TRANSFORMER DESTRUCTION
  override protection settings of both transformers
  open earth-switch after trafo
  close other earth switch before trafo
  leave open disconn. before trafo
  send timed oper for switch, then timed oper for disconnector
 - SMASH PC (Action 2)

drone: getaway

ninja: rope to get away

drone-pilot: put acorn in earth-switch to prevent immediate failure
