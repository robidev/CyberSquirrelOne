BUGS:
FINAL: tweak surveillance-camera behaviour/timing
explain usage/goal of code-lock better
bug with dialog immediately disapearing when ninja enters building
maybe bug with ninja being spawned wrong after reload???

 - meanwhile bird sweeps in to save hedgehog, and both fly off - 
  the 3 fly away, and the building explodes
 #cyberwar4ever

add breakable fan dialog
add gameover if fall in rotating fan
add smoke particle effect when breaking fan
  hacker smash computer?

load serialized data when starting level1_C
improve loading/naming savegame-data
bird-fly-in trigger
bird fly-off path
more guidance dialogs

adding:
make flyoff-scene better
make powerline on/off more clear
 better vantage point by trees?

 nightfall-atmospheric? fog, light reflection,  extra: env will change based on switching in HMI
 add more scenery schrubs, cars, signs etc.

puzzle2:
trafo1 enabled, trafo2 disabled

desktop with:
 - HMI
 - engineering-tool: shows tree-view with similar names, and associated settings(settings-write, timed oper and interlock change can be from here)
 - top-view of station?
 - documentation (what are the componenst and their properties, 
 - how to open/close in HMI and read values
 - how to change protection settings,  what is interlocking?
 - footnotes about interlock-override and timed operate (explain there is a max future time)
 - desktop and immages folder with funny stuff
 - security cam feeds
dialog:
 - explain to first destroy cabinets, then trafos for max damage
 - explain too much load will trip the line
 - 


Scenario:
 distribution cabinets all on
 disable interlocking logic
 turn each disconnector off, one by one,  disconnector-open command. see result by security-cam
 - timed operate is possible/encouraged

goal1:
 see cabinets explode by security-cam


incoming earth-sw is on
 turn outgoing earth-sw off
 engage trafo2 outgoing disconector, to connect to other busbar.
 enable trafo2 CB, while incoming disconn. still off, running current from trafo1, trough the bus to trafo2, trough incoming earth-switch(pilot sets resistance?)
 do-remote interlock override, do remote prot-settings, do it via timed operate
goal2
 see trafo's explode
 - if you do this before all distribution-stuff is broken, and you're still there(not timed), you get 'bad' ending
 - if a timed operate is set, and the result would be destruction, puzzle ends, and epilogue starts with timer that has been set..


help:
 explain function of CB
 explain function of DIS
 explain function of trafo
 explain current-flow
 explain that cabinet-interlock is logical trough protection relay, (and can be overwritten)
 explain consequence of overwritten interlock
 explain earth-switch
