TODO:
ninja-transformer-takeout->level complete
message/objective/story system
hedgehog???

drone-short near powerlines? bird-attack?

nightfall-atmospheric?
add more scenery

objectives:
 avoid bird
 lockpick-minigame
 HMI minigame->disable powerline, so ninja can enter
 tranformer-destruction animation+triggers
 engineer-animation+triggers
 hedgehog-behavior+animation+triggers
 triggers near bay/station/telecom-controllers(message: nah, too easy ;) )

is there a way, all squirrels can be positioned exact right, so that puzzle is solved? that you need to figure out the correct sequience, and when triggered, it just resolves

escape-route? via drone?


ninja       - cannot enter powerline with power
            + when power is down, he can reach switchyard, but no lockpick skills
	    + can lure/sneak past hedgehog?? catch22?
            + trafo is sabotaged by ninja

hacker      - cannot climb substation without help from drone
	    (+ can disable alarm/camera??????)
	    + can do lockpick, 
	    + can modify HMI to disable power, (and re-enable after ninja sabotage )
              (alternative: wait for mechanic to re-enable)

drone pilot - drone shorts when near switchyard
            + areal reconneisance? sniper-rifle? catapult?
	    + can pick-up and drop load to knock out guard/camera? provide lockpick/sabotage supplies?
	    + will provide drone support for hacker transport,  allows hacker to traverse fence and stay undetected



env:
Hedgehog    - mans the HMI, has to lured out(how? coffee??)
Trafo       - needs to be destroyed by ninja
Nightfall   - happens during intrusion

v Bird        - attack on ninja while on powerline
v Powerline   - used by ninja to get into substation
v Door        - needs to be lockpicked by hacker
v Camera      - when a squirrel is in a hotspot, the squirrel is taken away by van, possible to disable?
v HMI         - correct switch to enable ninja to traverse powerline, done by hacker, extra: env will change based on switching in HMI
