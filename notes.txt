BUGS:
FINAL: tweak surveillance-camera behaviour/timing
idle-animation during drone-transport, should be hanging
key-stuck during drone switch
make hacker passive at start(so drone cannot move him yet)
make drone fall visualisation
switch possibility to enable ninja sooner

alpha: 
 show clear visual power on/off for hacker/HMI
 explain/guide to HMI(what is a HMI??)
 explain 'enter' to open a door
 fix sound fx volume balance
 show zzzz for bird and hedgehog
 make puzzle2 (level1_end)

adding:
 better vantage point by trees?
 water, x  water-splash   - https://opengameart.org/content/water-splash-yo-frankie
 nightfall-atmospheric? fog, light reflection,  extra: env will change based on switching in HMI
 add more scenery schrubs, cars, signs etc.
x  static         - https://opengameart.org/content/static-noise-similar-untuned-tv-also-known-white-noise
x  walki-talkie/radio beep/bzzt - dialog - https://opengameart.org/content/camerashudder

option: have engineer respond to camera???? not in MVP...

objectives:

 triggers near bay/station/telecom-controllers(message: nah, too easy ;) )


ninja       - cannot enter powerline with power
            + when power is down, he can reach switchyard, but no lockpick skills
	    + can blowdart hedgehog?? catch22?
            + trafo is sabotaged by ninja+drone pilot

hacker      - cannot climb substation without help from drone
	    (+ can disable alarm/camera??????)
	    + can do lockpick, 
	    + can modify HMI to disable power, (and re-enable after ninja sabotage )
              (alternative: wait for hedgehog/mechanic to re-enable?)

drone pilot - drone gets attacked by bird
            + areal reconneisance?
	    + can throw acorn to knock out guard/camera
	    + will provide drone support for hacker transport,  allows hacker to traverse fence and stay undetected

Puzzle1:
you can modify the circuit (by wire? by input? how to do this robust, without removing the 'fun' or overcomplicating?) -> provide datasheets of IC's as hint
if you force WP high, you prevent the tries from incrementing
with infinite tries, you should be able to do it in 25 attempts or so.


Puzzle2:
????
top view
switch components, and ensure protection does not work correctly, so that 5 trafo's destruct
part switchyard, part protection-bays
