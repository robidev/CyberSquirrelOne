BUGS:
does AI/collision detection work offscreen
tweak camera triggers
tweak enemy colliders
tweak enemy/camera detector triggers(not onenter, but always)
idle-animation during drone-transport, should be hanging
cannot throw acorn when in front of building
improve ninja blowdart visual/explanation
show zzzz for bird and hedgehog
show clear visual power on/off for hacker/HMI
hacker/pilot facing wrong direction
improve font for readablility
explain/guide to HMI
explain 'enter' to open a door

explain tabbing to players



make puzzle2 (level1_end)
limit switching or switch for the player based on triggers
implement ninja japanese dialog(explain why he is on the other side of the level)
tweak the storytelling
tweak surveillance-camera behaviour/timing


adding:
better vantage point by trees?
water
nightfall-atmospheric? fog, light reflection,  extra: env will change based on switching in HMI
add more scenery


option: have engineer respond to camera???? not in MVP...

objectives:

 triggers near bay/station/telecom-controllers(message: nah, too easy ;) )


ninja       - cannot enter powerline with power
            + when power is down, he can reach switchyard, but no lockpick skills
	    + can blowdart hedgehog?? catch22?
            + trafo is sabotaged by ninja+drone pilot

hacker      - cannot climb substation without help from drone
	    (+ can disable alarm/camera??????)
	    + can do lockpick, 
	    + can modify HMI to disable power, (and re-enable after ninja sabotage )
              (alternative: wait for hedgehog/mechanic to re-enable?)

drone pilot - drone gets attacked by bird
            + areal reconneisance?
	    + can throw acorn to knock out guard/camera
	    + will provide drone support for hacker transport,  allows hacker to traverse fence and stay undetected

Puzzle1:
you can modify the circuit (by wire? by input? how to do this robust, without removing the 'fun' or overcomplicating?) -> provide datasheets of IC's as hint
if you force WP high, you prevent the tries from incrementing
with infinite tries, you should be able to do it in 25 attempts or so.


Puzzle2:
????
top view
switch components, and ensure protection does not work correctly, so that 5 trafo's destruct
part switchyard, part protection-bays
