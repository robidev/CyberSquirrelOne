Known bug:
text editor scroll is broken

BUGS:
FINAL: tweak surveillance-camera behaviour/timing
hedgehog attack tweaking
Explosion sound on final explosion

MAIN MENU
 enter codes for jumping to a level
 outro: rolling credits

DRAWING
 better indication of fence->sign/perspective

HUD
 HUD indication of abilities and current selection
 HUD indication of mission checklist
 HUD guidance where to go for next mission item (arrow?)

SERIALIZATION
 drone-checkpoint+safe-zone
 coffee machine serialize does nothing
 load serialized data when starting level1_C
 improve loading/naming savegame-data


HMI
 - implement HMI alarms-window -> add any alarm also to messages, a disabled/cleared alarm disapears (click acknowledge, click clear)
 - implement HMI message window -> fill with a bunch of historical messages
 - implement helps:
	 explain function of CB
	 explain function of DIS
	 explain function of trafo
	 explain current-flow
	 explain that cabinet-interlock is logical trough protection relay, (and can be overwritten)
	 explain consequence of overwritten interlock
	 explain earth-switch

GUI
 - implement documents -> guides, and personal
 - add calendar with access-denied flag
 - help button

TODO/BUGS:
menubar options->attach events!!!



adding/future:
 improve switch-icons in regard to power-flow colloring?
 better vantage point by trees?
 digging equipment outside fence
 water, x  water-splash   - https://opengameart.org/content/water-splash-yo-frankie
 nightfall-atmospheric? fog, light reflection,  extra: env will change based on switching in HMI
 add more scenery schrubs, cars, signs etc.

puzzle2:
trafo1 enabled, trafo2 disabled

desktop with:
 - top-view of station image?
 - documentation (what are the componenst and their properties, 
 - how to open/close in HMI and read values
 - how to change protection settings,  what is interlocking?
 - footnotes about interlock-override and timed operate (explain there is a max future time)
 - desktop and immages folder with funny stuff
dialog:
 - explain to first destroy cabinets, then trafos for max damage
 - explain too much load will trip the line
 - 


Scenario:
 distribution cabinets all on
 disable interlocking logic
 turn each disconnector off, one by one,  disconnector-open command. see result by security-cam
 - timed operate is possible/encouraged

goal1:
 see cabinets explode by security-cam


incoming earth-sw is on
 turn outgoing earth-sw off
 engage trafo2 outgoing disconector, to connect to other busbar.
 enable trafo2 CB, while incoming disconn. still off, running current from trafo1, trough the bus to trafo2, trough incoming earth-switch(pilot sets resistance?)
 do-remote interlock override, do remote prot-settings, do it via timed operate
goal2
 see trafo's explode
 - if you do this before all distribution-stuff is broken, and you're still there(not timed), you get 'bad' ending
 - if a timed operate is set, and the result would be destruction, puzzle ends, and epilogue starts with timer that has been set..
