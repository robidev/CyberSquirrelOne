BUGS:
does AI/collision detection work offscreen
tweak camera triggers
tweak enemy colliders
tweak enemy detector triggers(not onenter, but always)
resizing behavior of puzzle1
idle-animation during drone-transport, should be hanging

TODO:
provide control-hints with 'h'
add sound


make puzzle2 (level1_end)
limit switching or switch for the player based on triggers
implement ninja japanese dialog(explain why he is on the other side of the level)
tweak the storytelling
tweak surveillance-camera behaviour/timing


adding:
better vantage point by trees?
water
nightfall-atmospheric? fog, light reflection,  extra: env will change based on switching in HMI
add more scenery


option: have engineer respond to camera???? not in MVP...

objectives:
 avoid bird
 lockpick-minigame
 HMI minigame->disable powerline, so ninja can enter
 tranformer-destruction animation+triggers
 hedgehog-behavior+animation+triggers

 triggers near bay/station/telecom-controllers(message: nah, too easy ;) )


ninja       - cannot enter powerline with power
            + when power is down, he can reach switchyard, but no lockpick skills
	    + can blowdart hedgehog?? catch22?
            + trafo is sabotaged by ninja+drone pilot

hacker      - cannot climb substation without help from drone
	    (+ can disable alarm/camera??????)
	    + can do lockpick, 
	    + can modify HMI to disable power, (and re-enable after ninja sabotage )
              (alternative: wait for hedgehog/mechanic to re-enable?)

drone pilot - drone gets attacked by bird
            + areal reconneisance?
	    + can throw acorn to knock out guard/camera
	    + will provide drone support for hacker transport,  allows hacker to traverse fence and stay undetected



Tile:

forest backdrop     - day/night TODO
substation-backdrop - day/night  TODO
city-backdrop       - day/night  TODO
day-night transition animation


backlog:
 blow-up (small/big) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDsDb7V59o


Puzzle1:
you can modify the circuit (by wire? by input? how to do this robust, without removing the 'fun' or overcomplicating?) -> provide datasheets of IC's as hint
if you force WP high, you prevent the tries from incrementing
with infinite tries, you should be able to do it in 25 attempts or so.


Puzzle2:
????
top view
switch components, and ensure protection does not work correctly, so that 5 trafo's destruct
part switchyard, part protection-bays
