BUGS:
FINAL: tweak surveillance-camera behaviour/timing
hedgehog attack tweaking

TODO/BUGS:
video in webgl -> sprite or .webm video?
menubar options->attach events

GUI
 - implement documents -> guides, and personal
 - add calendar or xeyes?
 - add terminal-function
 - add tooltips


HMI
 - start with HMI
 - implement switch to camera, when exploding, block controls
 - revisit HMI trafo-1-alignment
 - message for slow-switch in operate-window
 - close-button in operate window
 - implement HMI alarms-window
 - implement HMI RTU's window
 - rename all RTU/component names
 - improve value-display in HMI

 - implement helps:
	 explain function of CB
	 explain function of DIS
	 explain function of trafo
	 explain current-flow
	 explain that cabinet-interlock is logical trough protection relay, (and can be overwritten)
	 explain consequence of overwritten interlock
	 explain earth-switch

GAME
 - add dialogs

outro: rolling credits?

DRAWING
 better indication of fence

HUD
 HUD indication of abilities and current selection
 HUD indication of mission checklist
 HUD guidance where to go for next mission item (arrow?)

SERIALIZATION
 drone-checkpoint+safe-zone
 coffe machine serialize does nothing
 load serialized data when starting level1_C
 improve loading/naming savegame-data



adding/future:
 hacker smash computer?
 better vantage point by trees?
 water, x  water-splash   - https://opengameart.org/content/water-splash-yo-frankie
 nightfall-atmospheric? fog, light reflection,  extra: env will change based on switching in HMI
 add more scenery schrubs, cars, signs etc.

puzzle2:
trafo1 enabled, trafo2 disabled

desktop with:
 - top-view of station image?
 - documentation (what are the componenst and their properties, 
 - how to open/close in HMI and read values
 - how to change protection settings,  what is interlocking?
 - footnotes about interlock-override and timed operate (explain there is a max future time)
 - desktop and immages folder with funny stuff
dialog:
 - explain to first destroy cabinets, then trafos for max damage
 - explain too much load will trip the line
 - 


Scenario:
 distribution cabinets all on
 disable interlocking logic
 turn each disconnector off, one by one,  disconnector-open command. see result by security-cam
 - timed operate is possible/encouraged

goal1:
 see cabinets explode by security-cam


incoming earth-sw is on
 turn outgoing earth-sw off
 engage trafo2 outgoing disconector, to connect to other busbar.
 enable trafo2 CB, while incoming disconn. still off, running current from trafo1, trough the bus to trafo2, trough incoming earth-switch(pilot sets resistance?)
 do-remote interlock override, do remote prot-settings, do it via timed operate
goal2
 see trafo's explode
 - if you do this before all distribution-stuff is broken, and you're still there(not timed), you get 'bad' ending
 - if a timed operate is set, and the result would be destruction, puzzle ends, and epilogue starts with timer that has been set..
